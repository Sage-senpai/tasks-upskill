The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag
 is used to specify the character encoding of an HTML document.

In HTML5, the charset attribute is part of the meta tag, and it is used to declare the character 
encoding used for the HTML document. UTF-8 is a character encoding that supports a wide range of 
characters, including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other scripts.

By including the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag in the head section of an HTML document, you ensure that the
 document is displayed correctly in all browsers, regardless of the character encoding used by the operating system or the web server.

Using the correct character encoding is important to ensure that text and special 
characters are displayed correctly in the browser, and to prevent any issues with character encoding conversion.

In summary, the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding used for an HTML document, and it is used to ensure that the document is 
displayed correctly in all browsers.
