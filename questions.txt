1. What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements? 
    Normal HTML elements, also known as presentational
     or non-semantic elements, are used to define the 
     structure and presentation of a webpage. 
     Examples include <div> and <span>. These elements do not provide any information about the content they enclose.

Semantic HTML elements, on the other hand, 
are used to provide meaning and context to the content they 
enclose. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <nav>. These elements help search engines and screen readers understand the content of a webpage.

In summary, normal HTML elements are used for structure and presentation, 
while semantic HTML elements are used to provide meaning and context to the content


2. Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML.
     closing tags are used to indicate the end of an element,
      while self-closing tags are used for empty elements that do not have any content or do not require a closing tag
    closing tags are used to indicate the end of an element. They are mandatory for most elements, such as <p>, <div>, and <table>. 
    Closing tags help ensure that the content is properly structured and displayed.

Self-closing tags, on the other hand, are used for elements that do not have any content or do not require a closing tag. 
These elements are also known as empty elements. Examples include <br>, <img>, and <input>. Self-closing tags do not require a separate closing tag, 
and can be written as a single tag with a forward slash before the closing bracket, like this: <br />.


 3. What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML
 inline elements occupy only the space that is necessary for the content they contain and do not start on a new line, 
 while block elements occupy the full width of their parent element, start on a new line, and can contain other block or inline elements.
In HTML, elements are categorized as either inline or block. Inline elements occupy only the space that is necessary for the content they contain,
 and they do not start on a new line. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <img>, and <b>.

Block elements, on the other hand, occupy the full width of their parent element and start on a new line.
 They also have a default width and height, and they can contain other block or inline elements. Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, <article>, and <header>.
